## Mission-driven cyber researcher with a focus on cyber-resilency and seamless integration.

My approach is to provide ***cyber solutions that support the business***.   Security features should support, not impede, the desired function of the system.   Realizing that cyber-attacks are inevitable, I focus on approaches that allow the system to operate while under attack. I leverage automation (mostly python and ruby) to ensure that my solutions scale and integrate well into DevOps factory environments.

**Current Focus Areas**: *Embedded Systems/Avionics/IoT*

## Passionate leader and teacher who values diversity, collaboration and teaching

My design approach blends agile methodologies and diverse teams of experienced and novice developers.    My research teams typically include both experienced engineers, who bring a wealth of domain-specific experience, and junior engineers, who bring fresh, and often startling insights into cyber defense.  Over the past 5 years, I have invested heavily in college internship programs to bring fresh perspectives to some of today's cyber defenseproblems.   This investment has paid off for the industry, with a large number of systems and software engineers that are 'cyber aware' and for me, allowing hands-on opportunities to learn about today's leading technology disruptors.   

**Current Learning Areas**: *Machine Learning/Reverse Engineering*

##  Enthusiastic maker, looking to blend the technology into the fabric of our life

What a great time to be alive as a technologist!   Innovations in the Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, software development and manufacturing are touching every aspect of our lives.   Luckily, an overactive imagination, a perpetual case of insomnia, and an extremely patient spouse allow me ample opportunity to experiment and tinker with many of them.   The results include a very automated "smart home", a well-equipped maker-lab, and a long list of hobbies.

**Hobby Areas**:  *Raspberry Pi/Arduino/3D Printing*
