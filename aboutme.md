## Mission-driven cyber researcher with a focus on cyber-resilency and seamless integration.

My approach is to provide ***cyber solutions that support the mission*** and use-cases of the system.   Realizing that cyber-attacks are inevitable, I focus on approaches to power through an attack. I leverage my executive experience (trained at West Point and honed as an executive on Wall Street) and technical depth (gained protecting systems integrated into our nation's critical infrastructure) into solutions designed to integrate elegantly into today's leading technology platforms.

**Current Focus Areas**: *Embedded Systems/Avionics/IoT*

## Passionate leader and teacher who values diversity, collaboration and teaching

My design approach blends agile methodologies and diverse teams of experienced and novice developers.    Over the past 5 years, I have invested heavily in internship programs, both to overcome the shortfall of cyber engineering talent and to bring fresh perspectives to some of today's tough technology problems.   This investment has paid off for the industry, with a large number of systems and software engineers that are 'cyber aware' and for me, allowing for hands-on opportunities to learn about today's leading technology disruptors.   

**Current Learning Areas**: *Machine Learning/Python/Reverse Engineering*

##  Enthusiastic maker, looking to blend the technology into the fabric of our life

What a great time to be alive as a technologist!   Innovations in the Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, software development and manufacturing are touching every aspect of our lives.   Luckily, an overactive imagination, a perpetual case of insomnia, and an extremely patient spouse allow me ample opportunity to experiment and tinker with many of them.   The results include a very automated "smart home", a well-equipped maker-lab, and a long list of hobbies.

**Hobby Areas**:  *Raspberry Pi/Arduino/3D Printing*
