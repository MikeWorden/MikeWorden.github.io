## Mission-driven cyber researcher with a focus on cyber-resilency and seamless integration.

My approach is to provide ***cyber solutions that support the business***.   Security features should support, not impede, the desired function of the system.   Realizing that cyber-attacks are inevitable, I focus on approaches that allow the system to operate while under attack. I leverage automation (mostly python and ruby) to ensure that my solutions scale and integrate well into DevOps factory environments.

**Current Focus Areas**: *DevSecOps/Avionics/IoT*


##  Enthusiastic maker, looking to blend the technology into the fabric of our life

What a great time to be alive as a technologist!   Innovations in the Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, software development and manufacturing are touching every aspect of our lives.   Luckily, an overactive imagination, a perpetual case of insomnia, and an extremely patient spouse allow me ample opportunity to experiment and tinker with many of them.   The results include a very automated "smart home", a well-equipped maker-lab, and a long list of hobbies.

**Hobby Areas**:  *Raspberry Pi/Arduino/3D Printing*
